# Hardhat Project
[Doc](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#overview)

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm run compile # compile
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

## example
* [get someone's balance and transfer](./scripts/token.js)

## Notice
Complie first. Then can run `node xxx.js` to intract with Contract.
